# Data Structures

## Python Built-Ins
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries

## Non Built-Ins
- Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs

I want to practice implementing all of these at least in a basic sense. I also
want to check out hash maps despite their implementation as dictionaries in 
the standard Python library.
